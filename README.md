## Aviator Game Guide

Understanding the mechanics of Aviator is crucial to maximizing your
gaming experience. Here\'s a detailed guide to help you navigate the
game:

### Objective of the Game

The primary goal in Aviator is to cash out before the plane flies away.
The multiplier increases as the plane ascends, and your winnings are
based on the multiplier at the time of cashing out.

### Gameplay Mechanics

1.  **Place Your Bet**: Choose your stake amount before the round
    starts. Bets can range from as low as ₹0.10 to a maximum of ₹700 per
    round.
2.  **Start the Round**: Once the bet is placed, the plane takes off,
    and the multiplier begins to increase.
3.  **Cash Out**: Click the \"Cash Out\" button at any point before the
    plane flies away to secure your winnings based on the current
    multiplier.
4.  **Win or Lose**: If you cash out in time, your payout is calculated
    by multiplying your bet by the multiplier. If the plane flies away
    before you cash out, you lose your bet.

### Example Scenario

-   **Bet Amount**: ₹100
-   **Multiplier at Cash Out**: 2.5x
-   **Winnings**: ₹250

However, if you fail to cash out before the plane departs, you lose the
₹100 bet.
